README

The game works by moving the mouse to move the player around the screen. 
The A and D keys rotate the player and S is used to shoot. W can also be 
used to fire bombs.
Kill as many zombies as you can without getting hit to get a highscore.

Then just double click on the Showdown application to open the game.
